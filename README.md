# b-cubed (bus buddy box)

## Brief Overview
Design project from SHAD that aims to make public transit more accessible to the visually impaired and to the general public. 
During Shad, I worked with a group of 5 other students to design and identify a problem within living spaces and find an optimal solution.
We went through the full design process and produced our first prototype in 2-3 weeks.

## The Problem
How might we help fully blind Canadians who are feeling disconnected to feel immersed in public areas and feel a better sense of community?

## Our Solution
Our solution consisted of 2 modifications to public transport. The main modification of interest is a physical communication hub that is integrated into the transit's database.
The communication hub is a box with a button that people can press to communicate with a chatbot connected to the transit's database. 
There are 3 main features:
- Navigation support
- Communication with the transit system
- Audio abilities

The code posted here is a small prototype of the navigation support. Given user input, it gives an audio output of directions and bus arrival times to a user.

#### F.e:
- How would I get from University of toronto to university of waterloo?
- Output: directions......
